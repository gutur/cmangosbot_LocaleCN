# mangosbot-bots
Bot AI Core from ike3 for cmangos/mangos classic/tbc/wotlk

Want to build CMaNGOS + bots on your own? You can! (currently only on MS Windows)

ðŸ’¡  To build CMaNGOS + ike3 bots you should use a a fork of CMaNGOS with ike3 bots module

Vanilla - https://github.com/celguar/mangos-classic

TBC - https://github.com/celguar/mangos-tbc

WotLK - https://github.com/celguar/mangos-wotlk

Important: use --recursive and use branch "ike3-bots" when you clone any of these repos, e.g.:

`git clone https://github.com/celguar/mangos-classic.git --recursive -b ike3-bots`


ðŸ’¡  I don't sync these forks with official cmangos too often so you need to use forks of Database:

Vanilla - https://github.com/celguar/classic-db

TBC - https://github.com/celguar/tbc-db

WotLK - https://github.com/celguar/wotlk-db


ðŸ’¡  If you're new to building CMaNGOS, check the official Windows guide
https://github.com/cmangos/issues/wiki/Detailed-installation-guide-for-Microsoft-Windows

Important: to enable ike3 bots you need to check it in cmake ( BUILD_IKE3_BOTS âœ… )


ðŸ’¡  After successful build get aiplayerbot.conf file from "src/modules/Bots/playerbot/aiplayerbot%expansion.conf.dist" (based on expansion you use) and put it to the same folder where mangosd.conf and realmd.conf are, and remove ".dist" from its name


ðŸ’¡  DB modifications:

  a)  Go to "src/modules/Bots/sql"
  
  b)  Apply .sql files from "characters" folder to characters database
  
  c)  Apply .sql files from "world" folder to world database
  
  d)  Apply .sql files from "playerbot" folder to playerbots database (classicplayerbots for classic, etc)
  
  **IMPORTANT**: playebot folder has several .sql files that have `vanilla`, `tbc` or `wotlk` in their names. You should **apply only ONE** of them, corresponding to expansion you use.

After you complete all steps above you can check bots config and start your server. It'll take some time for the first time, as gear/characters for bots will be generated at first launch. Have fun! ðŸ¥³
